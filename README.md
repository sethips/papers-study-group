- [1948 The Mathematical Theory of Communication](./1948-theory-of-communication-shannon.pdf) by Claude Shannon."The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately
a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer
to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic
aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual
message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each
possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design."

- [1949 The Monte Carlo Method](./1949-MonteCarlo-MetropolsAndUlam.pdf) by Metropolis and Ulam. September 1949 published in the Journal of The American Statistical Association.

- [1953 Equations Of State Calculations by Metropolis and Teller](./1953-EquationsOfStateCalculations-MetropolisAndTeller.pdf). The method consists of a modifed Monte Carlo integration over configuration space.

- [2011 Category Theoretic Analysis of Hierarchical Protein Materials and Social Networks](./2011-category-theory-protien-spivak.pdf) by David I. Spivak, Tristan Giesa, Elizabeth Wood, Markus J. Buehler. "Here we describe an application of category theory to describe structural and resulting functional properties of biological protein materials by developing so-called ologs. An olog is like a ‘‘concept web’’ or ‘‘semantic network’’ except that it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory."
