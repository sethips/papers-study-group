Papers, historical and otherwise.
- [1949 The Monte Carlo Method](./1949-MonteCarlo-MetropolsAndUlam.pdf) by Metropolis and Ulam. September 1949 published in the Journal of The American Statistical Association.

- [1953-EquationsOfStateCalculations-MetropolisAndTeller](./1953-EquationsOfStateCalculations-MetropolisAndTeller.pdf). The method consists of a modifed Monte Carlo integration over configuration space.

- [2011 Category Theoretic Analysis of Hierarchical Protein Materials and Social Networks](./2011-category-theory-protien-spivak.pdf). David I. Spivak, Tristan Giesa, Elizabeth Wood, Markus J. Buehler. Here we describe an application of category theory to describe structural and resulting functional properties of biological protein materials by developing so-called ologs. An olog is like a ‘‘concept web’’ or ‘‘semantic network’’ except that it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory.
